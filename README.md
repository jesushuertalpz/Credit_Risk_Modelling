# Credit_Risk_Modelling
This project is a personal credit risk modelling learning path that I undertook to explore how Python can be applied to financial use cases.
# Theorical bases
Credit Risk Modelling is used to estimate the probability of a borrower to go into default, this means that thanks to this models banks or another lender's institution can estimate the risk they will assume when lending money to a person or a company.
There are some important theorical concepts we should take into account:

1. Expected loss -> Average credit loss that we would expect from an exposure or a portfolio over a given period of time. This is usually calculated by the following equation: 
  ** Expected Loss (EL) = Probability of Default (PD) × Loss Given Default (LGD) × Exposure at Default (EAD)**
2. Exposure at default -> Is the total value a bank is exposed to when a borrower defaults on a loan.
3. Probability of default -> It's the finantial term describing the likehood of a default over a time horizon
4. Loss given default: Is the share of an asset that is lost when the borrower defaults.

It is important to understand that the ultimate objective of the lender is to minimize the expected loss. To achieve this, they must reduce one or more of the factors that influence expected loss.
